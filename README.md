## 📘 Project Description

This project analyzes *world population trends* from *1970 to 2050* using Python.  
It provides insights into population growth across continents and countries,  
helping forecast future demographic trends.

*Key Objectives:*
- Analyze population *growth by continent*  
- Identify *top 10 most populated countries*  
- Visualize *global population growth* (1970–2022)  
- Interpret trends using *Matplotlib* graphs

---

## 🧩 Steps Performed

1. Imported and cleaned population dataset  
2. Grouped data by continent for visualization  
3. Created bar charts and line charts using Matplotlib  
4. Saved graphs in .png format for presentation/reporting
